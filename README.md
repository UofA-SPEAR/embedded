# embedded #

This is all the code for the embedded systems on the rover.

I want to try using STM32 chips on our boards and use STM32CubeMX for configuring them, instead of Arduino, so that I can have some semblence of control over the build process.
Obviously depends on what members we get and how willing they are.
