# embedded #

This is all the code for the embedded systems on the rover.

## Running ##

Download and install [platformio](https://platformio.org).
You can use whatever text editor you want, recommended ones are atom or vscode.
If you're a little more advanced and want to use vim and platformio on the commandline go right on ahead.

```
git clone https://github.com/UofA-SPEAR/embedded.git
cd embedded/libuavcan
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This *should* set it up. I do need to verify this on a new install.
