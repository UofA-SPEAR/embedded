# Arm Controller Firmware #

Meant for running on arm controller boards.

Uses STM32F303. And a (possibly two in the future?) VNH5019 motor driver.

## TODO ##

- Add software motor direction changing
- Add configuration via CAN bus
- Add current sense/limiting
- Add incremental encoder inputs
- Add EMS22A encoder support
